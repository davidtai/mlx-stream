/* Event-gated pass-through primitives over MLX (mlx_event_shim.cpp: the DSV4.1 program's q3ev4 extension as a C
 * ABI for mlx-c callers). A wait's outputs ALIAS its inputs (no copy, no kernel); every consumer of an output
 * depends on it, so MLX encodes it after its inputs and before every consumer. On a GPU stream it ends the open
 * compute pass and encodes MTLCommandBuffer.encodeWaitForEvent:value: into the stream's current command buffer, so
 * the GPU waits for the pool to hand the event the value (lookahead pool, q3ld_ev_config). On a CPU stream a HOST
 * event (an int64 word the pool release-stores) makes the evaluating thread wait before the consumers are
 * dispatched. Built against MLX 0.32.2's metal backend headers: re-verify on every MLX bump. */
