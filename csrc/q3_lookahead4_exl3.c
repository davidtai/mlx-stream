/* DSV41_LOOKAHEAD4 pool (2026-09-25, q3-lookahead4-20260925.md): lookahead3/q3_lookahead.c (sha256 abd6ec68...,
 * symbols renamed q3lc_ -> q3ld_) + ONE addition, the EVENT-GATE class (the GPU waits on a shared event for the bytes):
 *   the host builds a parked layer-call's miss waves over event-gated bank aliases (the MLX extension ext/q3ev4.cpp
 *   encodes MTLCommandBuffer.encodeWaitForEvent:value: in front of them) and commits them with the next router barrier
 *   BEFORE the bytes land; q3ld_ev_gates registers, in the GPU's encode order, one value per gate with the tickets the
 *   gate waits for (the GU tickets of every fill of the call, then per part the DOWN tickets of the part's fills).
 *   publish(t) (a ticket became terminal, under the pool mutex) decrements its gate; the SATISFIED PREFIX (every gate
 *   <= v has all its tickets terminal) is handed to the event (q3ld_mtl_signal = [MTLSharedEvent setSignaledValue:],
 *   q3_event_shim.mm; or a host int64 word for the CPU backend) by the publishing worker right after it drops the
 *   mutex, under sig_mu, never decreasing.  A failed ticket is terminal too (the GPU runs the wave, the host drain
 *   raises the stock error and discards it).  A WATCHDOG thread forces the oldest unsatisfied gate after its deadline
 *   (SC_EV_WD_FORCED: the host raises, the output may be invalid): a lost signal can never hang the GPU; stop releases
 *   every live gate.  Keyed by TICKET only (plans / slots / policy never see a gate).  No new staging.
 *
 * The lookahead3 pool's own header follows.
 *
 * DSV41_LOOKAHEAD3 pool (2026-09-25, q3-lookahead3-20260925.md): lookahead2/q3_lookahead.c (sha256 b6b127b5...,
 * symbols renamed q3lb_ -> q3ld_) + ONE addition, the PRE-READ class (lever A: host resume -> first demand read):
 *   q3ld_pre_read(fd, size, tag, n, bases), called by the generation thread right after the router barrier returns
 *   (before the flush / observe / planner / transaction glue that the stock issue waits for), takes the layer-call's
 *   CERTAIN misses (the route's unique experts not in the bank's resident map; only the planner edits that map, so it
 *   is the plan's miss set) as record bases.  Per record: a live speculative record containing it is CLAIMED now (the
 *   claim the demand submit would make ~0.3 ms later; a QUEUED one is cancelled and the bytes pre-read instead, as the
 *   submit would read them); otherwise its GU range and DOWN range are queued as PRE-RANGES (every GU first, then every
 *   DOWN: the stock batch-fill order).  A demand worker with no job queued takes the oldest pre-range and runs the
 *   STOCK range loop (run_range: aligned F_NOCACHE preadv into ITS OWN 9 MiB staging buffer, short-read
 *   continuation, the same syscalls and bytes) up to the first scatter copy, where it waits for the range's rows.
 *   q3ld_submit BINDS each job range (fd, offset, component lengths all equal; job without a deadline) to its pre-range:
 *   in flight / waiting -> the rows are attached and that worker scatters and finishes the loop; still QUEUED -> the
 *   pre-range is cancelled and the job reads the range itself (stock).  The job's own worker, reaching a bound range,
 *   waits until the pre-range is DONE and publishes ITS result words in ticket order (the completion-log contract of
 *   the native-issue pump is unchanged: a fill's tickets complete in index order, by one worker).  Unbound pre-ranges
 *   expire at the layer-call's settle (spec_step / spec_stepn), at the next pre_read and at quiesce; a pre-range whose
 *   job skips it (an earlier range failed) is cancelled at the bind point and never writes its rows.  A pre-running
 *   worker counts as demand busy (the speculative queue rule sees it) and in the read gauge.  Keyed by FILE OFFSET only;
 *   plans / slots / policy never see a pre-range; exactness: a range's bytes and result words are those of the same
 *   stock read, started earlier.  Counters SC_PRE_*; inject event kinds 9 (pre start) / 10 (pre served).
 *
 * The lookahead2 pool's own header follows.
 *
DSV41_LOOKAHEAD2 pool (2026-09-25, q3-lookahead2-20260925.md): lookahead/q3_lookahead.c (sha256 bb894ccc...,
 * symbols renamed q3la_ -> q3ld_) with ONE policy change, the DEMAND-IDLE SECOND STREAM:
 *   speculative thread 0 keeps the lane's queue rule (an unclaimed chunk starts only while qlen == 0 and demand
 *   busy <= 1); speculative threads >= 1 start / continue an UNCLAIMED chunk only while qlen == 0 and demand busy
 *   <= spec_idle_busy (q3ld_spec_streams, set at construction; 0 = no demand job executes; 1 = the lane's rule for
 *   every thread, i.e. the lookahead pool unchanged).  Claimed records ignore the rule (unchanged).  The replay
 *   (replay_route_lookahead.py tune5idle) prices the lane's second stream as mostly contention with the demand read
 *   it overlaps; keeping it off the drive while a demand job reads keeps its demand-idle work.  New counters:
 *   SC_IDLE_CHUNKS (unclaimed chunks started by threads >= 1), SC_MAX_BUSY_AT_START_IDLE (<= spec_idle_busy).
 *   Event kind 8 = an unclaimed chunk start by a thread >= 1 (kind 3 = by thread 0).
 *
 * The lookahead pool's own header follows.
 *
 * DSV41_LOOKAHEAD pool (2026-09-24, q3-lookahead-20260924.md).  The DSV41_NATIVE_ISSUE pool
 * (nativeissue/q3_nativeissue.c, sha256 6866b04b..., symbols renamed q3ni_ -> q3ld_, the demand path
 * transcribed unchanged) plus ONE addition: a low-priority, CHUNKED, SPECULATIVE op class, split into
 * per-HORIZON priority classes (prio 0 = the next layer, prio h-1 = h layers ahead).
 *
 * DEMAND (unchanged from q3_nativeissue.c): 4 workers, one per stock 9 MiB staging buffer, a FIFO job
 * queue, per range the stock aligned F_NOCACHE preadv loop + the scatter copy into the slot rows, the
 * result words + an ordered completion log published with a RELEASE store.  Two additions on the demand
 * path, both keyed by FILE OFFSET only (never by layer / expert / slot):
 *   - q3ld_submit CLAIMS every speculative record that contains one of the job's ranges: an in-flight,
 *     parked or landed record is promoted (it now reads its remaining chunks back to back, ignoring the
 *     queue rule); a record still QUEUED (never started) is cancelled (the demand job reads those bytes);
 *   - before a range reads, a CLAIMED / LANDED record that contains the range serves it: the worker waits
 *     (never past the job's deadline) until the record's contiguous landed prefix covers the range, then
 *     memcpy-scatters it from the speculative staging (0 preadv).  Otherwise the stock read runs unchanged.
 *
 * SPECULATIVE op class (records live in their OWN staging slots and are read by their OWN threads):
 *   - a record is read as ceil(span / chunk) page-aligned CHUNKS (span = the page-aligned whole record);
 *   - QUEUE RULE (demand first, then nearer horizons): an UNCLAIMED record starts, and starts each further
 *     chunk, only while the demand queue is EMPTY (qlen == 0) and at most SPEC_MAX_DEMAND_BUSY (= 1) demand
 *     job executes, and (prio > 0) no record of a NEARER horizon is QUEUED.  At a boundary where that fails
 *     a prio-0 record pauses in place (the horizon-1 behaviour), a prio > 0 record PARKS (its thread is freed,
 *     its landed chunks kept; any thread resumes it later).  Pick order: claimed, then prio, then age;
 *   - q3ld_spec_step(cur, bases): horizon 1 (the h1 lane, unchanged): settle tag <= cur, issue tag cur + 1;
 *   - q3ld_spec_stepn(cur, nh, val, issue): horizon N: settle tag <= cur; RE-VALIDATE every unclaimed record
 *     with cur < tag <= cur + nh whose class is farther than its remaining distance (tag - cur) against the
 *     fresh candidate list for that target (val[tag - cur]): kept -> promoted to class tag - cur - 1, else
 *     dropped (queued / parked: now; running: at its next chunk boundary); then issue per horizon h the
 *     records issue[h] with tag cur + h, class h - 1;
 *   - reclaim: FREE first, else the oldest LANDED / FAILED slot with no reader and tag < cur;
 *   - a demand range holds `readers` on the slot while copying: a slot is never reclaimed under a copy.
 *
 * Counters (Python-owned int64[SC_N], written under the pool mutex, read at teardown): see SC_*.
 * Profile builds (-DQ3LD_EVSIG, -Ddsv41-decode-timers=true) keep only the event's signal log (q3ld_test_ev_log).
 * Test build (-DQ3LD_INJECT): the q3ni injection rules/delays, a speculative per-chunk delay and an event
 * log of demand submit / demand start / speculative chunk start with (qlen, busy, nearer-queued) at that
 * instant.

/* EXL3_LANE_PORT (exl3/runtime/ports/gen_exl3_ports.py; q3-exl3-lane-ports-20260927.md): lookahead4/q3_lookahead.c with ONE change,
 * a per-record payload length in the speculative and pre-read classes, for the EXL3 variant bank whose layers carry
 * different record lengths (K = 2 layers: 8,891,904 B logical records inside 13,315,584 B slots):
 *   - spec_t.len = the record's payload bytes; spec_containing, the chunk span and the landed cap use it instead of the
 *     configured rec_len, which becomes the LARGEST record (the staging slot is sized from it, as before);
 *   - q3ld_spec_step_len(fd, size, cur, n, bases, len): q3ld_spec_step whose records carry the target layer's length
 *     (0 < len <= rec_len): a speculative read covers [base, base + len) and never the next record;
 *   - q3ld_pre_read_lens(fd, size, tag, n, bases, lens): q3ld_pre_read with the call's layer component lengths (ngu then
 *     ndown, the counts armed by q3ld_pre_config); the demand submit of that layer passes the same lengths, so the bind
 *     (same fd, offset, component lengths) holds, and a pre-range covers exactly the layer's span;
 *   - the stock entry points (q3ld_spec_step / _spec_stepn / _pre_read) behave as before (len = rec_len, the armed
 *     lengths): a uniform-record bank reads exactly as with the original pool.  ABI 2026092704 (original 2026092504).
 * ABI 2026100201.
