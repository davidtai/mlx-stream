//! The plugin SDK (docs/plugins.md): the one module a plugin imports. The small SDK: what a module-owned arch needs
//! from the host (G1 module-owned decode state, G2 the phase change, G3 spec decode, G4 phase bills, the process
//! claim, the weight loader and the memory ledgers) as optional declarations of the kinds below. A seam only one
//! plugin consumes (an expert source, a kernel registry, a quant contract) stays in that plugin until a second
//! consumer exists. The registry (src/plugins.zig) builds each kind's table once, at compile time, and the host
//! resolves a model's tables once at load: a hook runs per request, step or round, never per layer.
//!
//! `KVCache`, `ForwardCtx` and `Linear` (an arch over the host's cache) land with their first consumer: the
//! archs registered so far own their decode state (G1).
