//! What mlx-stream adds beside the host's `sdk`: the seams only this plugin consumes, kept here rather than in the host
//! (a kind's interface lands in the host with its second consumer). The expert source (G6: the record layout, the read
//! pool, the slot cache, the residency policy and the stream), the kernel registry (G5), the EXL3 / gather quant
//! contract and its comptime tables, the KV lanes of the module-owned decode state, the profile probes and a host-side
//! strided copy. Everything here reaches the host through `sdk` only.
