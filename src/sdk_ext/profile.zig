//! G7, profile builds: a plugin's profile instruments reach the code of its other kinds as a hook its arch injects at
//! comptime, never as an import, so no kind imports another's profiling. The SDK declares the probes' shapes and the
//! hooks that compile to nothing; it carries no timer or counter of its own.
//!
//! The backend type an arch binds its quant and its source with declares the hook (`pub const profile_hook: Hook`);
//! the generic code they share reads it with `of(Backend)`, once, at comptime. A backend that declares none (a host
//! test backend, another arch's) gets `off`, and so does every probe of a build without the plugin's profile options:
//! a served build carries no clock read, counter, field or branch for them.
